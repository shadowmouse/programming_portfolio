# Elliot Francis -- Sample Code Portfolio

A significant portion of my projects are proprietary and so the full code is unavailable to be run for demonstration purposes. This repository represents a selection of the code from those projects that I am most proud of AND is either useless on its own or represents non-proprietary methods. The intent is to give potential employers an overview of my programming and problem solving style in the languages that I am most familiar with.

## Structure

This repository is broken up into a number of folders that cover the area or language contained there in. The first section is a link to full project repositories which I've worked on in my personal time and are in a state to be displayed or used. All other sections contain a list of the folder contents and a short description of the sample.
